(TEST 7) End of Input
COMMENTS:
Checks that if the end of input is reached, the program exits
correctly printing nothing extra. End of input is triggered
interactively by pressing 'Ctrl-d' in a terminal. In batch mode, it is
triggered by reaching the end of an input stream (file). In such
cases, C input functions like fscanf() return the special value EOF.


program: ./treemap_main -echo
Failure messages:
- FAILURE(137) due to TIMEOUT: Runtime exceeded maximum of '5s'
